# Code for "Escape fractions from unattenuated Ly\alpha emitters around luminous z>6 quasars"

This directory holds the code used for paper "Escape fractions from unattenuated Ly\alpha emitters around luminous z>6 quasars"  (arxiv: 2507.05381). The reduced spectra are stored at zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.17188911.

I also included Table 1 in the paper in the format of LaTeX pseudocode, and tables for the galaxies in both quasar fields in FITS format. In the FITS tables, fields with uncertainties of -1 means the corresponding quantity is an upper limit.
